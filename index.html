      <p>My name is Lisa Huey. Alongside working fulltime, I am currently a full stack flex student at UC Berkeley Extension. Prior to this, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration and am also a licensed California real estate agent. I have 3 dogs: a 4 year old corgi-shiba mix, a 6 year old chihuahua-terrier mix, and an 11 year old full bred chihuahua. The best part of my day is coming home from work to them.</p>
      <p>Aside from loving my dogs, I also love to travel and eat. I've been to Hawaii, Mexico, and Florida this past year. I am planning on visiting Japan and China this year to try authentic Kobe beef and Peking duck.
      When I am not traveling nor eating, I enjoy watching movies and singing karaoke. My 2 favorite films of 2018 were Crazy Rich Asians and Avengers: Infinity War. I am looking forward to seeing Captain Marvel and Avengers: End Game this year. I've got my popcorn ready!</p>
